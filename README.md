# Sushu's Taco Shop

Welcome to **Sushu's Taco Shop**! This project is a static website built using HTML and CSS. It showcases a fictional taco shop, complete with an index page, a contact page, and a page for hours of operation.

## Project Overview
This project was inspired by a challenge from a mentor on GitHub @gitdagray. The goal was to create a complete website using HTML and CSS, following the instructions and reference images provided by the mentor. This project helped me to reinforce my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and I am excited to share the final result.

## Features
- **Home Page**: A welcoming page with information about Sushu's Taco Shop.
- **Contact Page**: A page where users can find contact information.
- **Hours Page**: A page that displays the operating hours of the taco shop.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to **Dave Gray sir** for the incredible challenge and the invaluable guidance provided through his YouTube tutorials on HTML. This project would not have been possible without his support and the resources he made available. You can find the original challenge and reference images on his GitHub repository [html_course](https://github.com/gitdagray/html_course).
